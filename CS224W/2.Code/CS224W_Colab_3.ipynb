        "Now let's start working on our own implementation of layers! This part is to get you familiar with how to implement Pytorch layer based on Message Passing. You will be implementing the **forward**, **message** and **aggregate** functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Generally, the **forward** function is where the actual message passing is conducted. All logic in each iteration happens in **forward**, where we'll call **propagate** function to propagate information from neighbor nodes to central nodes.  So the general paradigm will be pre-processing -> propagate -> post-processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Recall the process of message passing we introduced in homework 1. **propagate** further calls **message** which transforms information of neighbor nodes into messages, **aggregate** which aggregates all messages from neighbor nodes into one, and **update** which further generates the embedding for nodes in the next iteration.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our implementation is slightly variant from this, where we'll not explicitly implement **update**, but put the logic for updating nodes in **forward** function. To be more specific, after information is propagated, we can further conduct some operations on the output of **propagate**. The output of **forward** is exactly the embeddings after the current iteration.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition, tensors passed to **propagate()** can be mapped to the respective nodes $i$ and $j$ by appending _i or _j to the variable name, .e.g. x_i and x_j. Note that we generally refer to $i$ as the central nodes that aggregates information, and refer to $j$ as the neighboring nodes, since this is the most common notation.\n",

Pay attention to the shape here: $x\\_i$ and $x\\_j$ are both of shape E * d (**not N!**). $x\\_i$ is obtained by concatenating the embeddings of central nodes of all edges through lookups from $x_{central}$ we passed in propagate. Similarly, $x\\_j$ is obtained by concatenating the embeddings of neighbor nodes of all edges through lookups from $x_{neighbor}$ we passed in propagate.\n",

One of the major benefits of attention-based mechanisms is their ability to focus on the most relevant parts of the input to make decisions. In this problem, we will see how attention mechanisms can be used to perform node classification of graph-structured data through the usage of Graph Attention Networks (GATs).\n",
        "\n",
        "The building block of the Graph Attention Network is the graph attention layer, which is a variant of the aggregation function . Let $N$ be the number of nodes and $F$ be the dimension of the feature vector for each node. The input to each graph attentional layer is a set of node features: $\\mathbf{h} = \\{\\overrightarrow{h_1}, \\overrightarrow{h_2}, \\dots, \\overrightarrow{h_N}$\\}, $\\overrightarrow{h_i} \\in R^F$. The output of each graph attentional layer is a new set of node features, which may have a new dimension $F'$: $\\mathbf{h'} = \\{\\overrightarrow{h_1'}, \\overrightarrow{h_2'}, \\dots, \\overrightarrow{h_N'}\\}$, with $\\overrightarrow{h_i'} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{F'}$.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will now describe this transformation of the input features into higher-level features performed by each graph attention layer.

We use a shared attentional mechanism:\n",

To utilize graph structure in the attention mechanisms, we can use masked attention.

        "In previous Colabs we used both of graph class (NetworkX) and tensor (PyG) representations of graphs separately. The graph class `nx.Graph` provides rich analysis and manipulation functionalities, such as the clustering coefficient and PageRank. To feed the graph into the model, we need to transform the graph into tensor representations including edge tensor `edge_index` and node attributes tensors `x` and `y`. But only using tensors (as the graphs formatted in PyG `datasets` and `data`) will make many graph manipulations and analysis less efficient and harder. So, in this Colab we will use DeepSNAP which combines both representations and offers a full pipeline for GNN training / validation / testing.\n"
